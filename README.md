## hidewindow.py
  A simple script using X11 (Xlib) that enables or disables a window capture source whenever it gains or loses focus. 
  May be useful to hide the window when Alt+tabbing to show a background image or multimedia source underneath it.
  Can be easily tweaked to automatically swap between scenes as well.
