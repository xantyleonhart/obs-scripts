## hidewindow
  - hidewindow-xlib.py

    A simple script using X11 (Xlib) that enables or disables a window capture source whenever it gains or loses focus. 
    May be useful to hide the window when Alt+tabbing to show a background image or multimedia source underneath it.
    Can be easily tweaked to automatically swap between scenes as well.
  - hidewindow-win32.py

    Tweaked verison of `hidewindow-xlib.py`, using win32gui libary (which can be installed by `pip install pywin32`).
    Made by `sheriffoftiltover` on the OBS Fourms.
